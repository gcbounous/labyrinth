DBSql:
    -

DBText:
    - refactor saved games
    - refactor map (text + robot) (caso seja so um mapa salvo passar robot_point = None, nao precisa salvar) 

Improvements:
    - make a class inside globals only with gobal variables (like a enum) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/702834/whats-the-common-practice-for-enums-in-python

    - only show maze after door is opened once
    - do it animation-like (game._print_map())
    - score

    - Point:
        - order by x then y

    - Map_object:
        - order by point

    - Game
        - to pass through door reload in steps (animation_like)
        - arrows for directions
        - move "on keypress" 
        - use number before walking (4 up, walks 4 points up)
